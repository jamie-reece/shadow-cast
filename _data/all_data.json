Plus, they discuss the complicated relationship between poet and audience, Rob's upcoming tour entitled 'The Hair Show', what it means to be known as both a poet and a comic, and much more.\n\nRob reads his poems 'Poem about a kettle written while listening to a lot of Leonard Cohen', 'A Letter From Father Christmas', and 'My Favourite Bakery', which is probably the best poem about bread you'll hear all week.\n\nYou can catch Rob Auton at Bang Said The Gun, which has shows upcoming at the Soho Theatre in November and December 2017, and on The Hair Tour, in 2018.

Hailed by Brodsky as “the future of poetry”, it is still barely known outside the Netherlands. In it, the poet-narrator trails his mysterious neighbour – Awater – through the city night before abandoning the trail in a train station. Is the poem about the imagination, the unconscious mind, about bereavement, about the existential hollow in the wake of the First World War, about T.S. Eliot, about religion and the old world, about the future? With the help of David Colmer, Professor Wiljan van den Akker, poets Onno Kosters and Astrid Alben, and artist-writer Bette Adriaanse, Jane Draycott looks for answers to these questions. This audio piece is supported by the Dutch Foundation for Literature.",

Molecatching is a traditional skill that has given me a good life but I am old now and tired of hunting and it has taught me what I needed to learn.</em></li><li>Although common, moles are mysterious: their habits are inscrutable, they are anatomically bizarre, and they live completely alone. Marc Hamer has come closer to them than most, both through his long working life out in the Welsh countryside, and his experiences of rural homelessness as a boy, sleeping in hedgerows.</li><li>Over the years, Marc has learned a great deal about these small, velvet creatures who live in the dark beneath us, and the myths that surround them, and his work has also led him to a wise and uplifting acceptance of the inevitable changes that we all face. In this beautiful and meditative book, Marc tells his story and explores what moles, and a life in nature, can tell us about our own humanity and our search for contentment.</li><li><em>How to Catch a Mole</em>&nbsp;is a gem of nature writing, beautifully illustrated by Joe McLaren, which celebrates living peacefully and finding wonder in the world around us.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

When a man is swept away by the river in the early hours of Shrove Saturday, an explanation has to be found: accident, suicide or murder? The village priest, John Reve, is privy to many secrets in his role as confessor. But will he be able to unravel what happened to the victim, Thomas Newman, the wealthiest, most capable and industrious man in the village? And what will happen if he can’t?</p><p>Moving back in time towards the moment of Thomas Newman’s death, the story is related by Reve – an extraordinary creation, a patient shepherd to his wayward flock, and a man with secrets of his own to keep.

An international jet-setter, he now makes significant money managing DJs, but the constant travel, airport lounges, soulless hotel rooms and broken relationships have left him dissatisfied with his life. He’s then rocked by a chance encounter with Frank Begbie, from whom he’d been hiding for years after a terrible betrayal and the resulting debt.

It is about why we continue to avoid talking about race.</p><p>In this personal and provocative investigation, Afua Hirsch explores a very British crisis of identity. We are a nation in denial about our past and our present. We believe we are the nation of abolition, but forget we are the nation of slavery. We are convinced that fairness is one of our values, but that immigration is one of our problems.&nbsp;Brit(ish)&nbsp;is the story of how and why this came to be, and an urgent call for change.</p><p><br></p><p>Read more about Brit(ish): https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1112508/brit-ish/</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

Extricating Britain from Europe will be the greatest challenge this country has faced since the Second World War. And as negotiations with the EU expose the promises of the Brexit campaign to have been hollow, even some Brexit-voters now wish to exercise their democratic right to change their mind, seeing that the most pragmatic option is to … stop. It would certainly be the best thing for Britain. But&nbsp;how&nbsp;can it be done? Haven’t the people spoken?</p><p>No. In this indispensable handbook, Nick Clegg categorically debunks the various myths that have been used to force Brexit on Britain, not by ‘the people’ but by a small, extremely rich, self-serving elite, and explains precisely how this historic mistake can be reversed – and what you can do to make sure that it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Read more at https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1115718/how-to-stop-brexit-and-make-britain-great-again/#DYu2wvzT2BCKruGx.99</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

In these poems we encounter a Victorian diorama, a bar where a merchant mariner has a story he must tell, a chimeric creature – Miss Molasses – emerging from the old docks. There are poems in honour of Mancunia’s bureaucrats: the Master of the Lighting of Small Objects, the Superintendent of Public Spectacles, the Co-ordinator of Misreadings. Metaphysical and lyrical, the poems in Michael Symmons Roberts’ seventh collection are concerned with why and how we ascribe value, where it resides and how it survives. Mancunia is – like More’s Utopia – both a no-place and an attempt at the good-place. It is occupied, liberated, abandoned and rebuilt. Capacious, disturbing and shape-shifting, these are poems for our changing times.</p><p><br></p><p>Read more at https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1112493/mancunia/#ZiVegydh6ISYfdki.99</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

Keith, who claims to be a second cousin of his (absent) father, offers him one. On Keith’s card it says he does ‘distribution and delivery’, which seems to consist of ‘a lot of driving around, getting out of the car for a few minutes and then getting back in’, Sam tells his mother. And so the days go by, Keith driving to a trading estate, ducking into a portakabin, all the while telling Sam stories about his first boss, Geoff Crozier, his mentor in distribution and delivery. As the weeks pass, Sam gets to know Keith’s friends, flirty Hazel-Claire from whom they buy two pasties every day at lunchtime, a variety of receptionists, and a few tantalising secrets from Keith’s past…</p><p>As in&nbsp;Days of the Bagnold Summer,&nbsp;Joff Winterhart is a master at depicting ordinary life in all its utterly poignant and funny mundanity.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Driving Short Distances&nbsp;</em>is the new book by Joff Winterhart, whose first graphic novel<em>, Days of the Bagnold Summer</em>, was described by Posy Simmonds as ‘original, funny, touching and beautifully observed’ and was shortlisted for the Costa Award for Best Novel.</p><p><br></p><p>\"<strong>In&nbsp;<em>Driving Short Distances</em>&nbsp;Joff Winterhart has created an unforgettable central player</strong>, Keith Nutt, who deserves to join Keith Talent in the short but potent list of great British literary Keiths.

Winterhart has delivered a perfect book, as good as mostly much better than any of the regular novels I’ve read so far this year. Like his first… its characters are superbly drawn. But with its themes of depression and its tender examination of the ways men talk (and fail to talk) to one another, it has a depth that book perhaps lacked.&nbsp;<em>Days of the Bagnold Summer</em>&nbsp;was shortlisted for the 2012 costa Novel award. This time around, Winterhart deserves to win it.\" (Rachel Cooke&nbsp;<em>Observer</em>)</p><p><br></p><p>Read more at http://po.st/DrivingShortDistances</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

        "episode_desc": "<p>Xiaolu Guo meets her parents for the first time when she is almost seven. They are strangers to her. When she is born her parents hand her over to a childless peasant couple in the mountains. Aged two, and suffering from malnutrition on a diet of yam leaves, they leave Xiaolu with her illiterate grandparents in a fishing village on the East China Sea. It’s a strange beginning. A Wild Swans for a new generation, Once Upon a Time in the East takes Xiaolu from a run-down shack to film school in a rapidly changing Beijing, navigating the everyday peculiarity of modern China: censorship, underground art, Western boyfriends. In 2002 she leaves Beijing on a scholarship to study in Britain. Now, after a decade in Europe, her tale of East to West resonates with the insight that can only come from someone who is both an outsider and at home. Xiaolu Guo’s extraordinary memoir is a handbook of life lessons. How to be an artist when censorship kills creativity and the only job you can get is writing bad telenovela scripts. How to be a woman when female babies are regularly drowned at birth and sexual abuse is commonplace.

Suddenly he started receiving text messages asking if he was ok. Turning on the TV, Antoine watched the terrorist attacks in Paris unfolding around him and tried to call Hélène. She didn’t answer. That night Hélène was killed, along with 88 other people, at the Bataclan Theatre. Three days later, Antoine wrote an open letter to his wife’s killers on Facebook. He refused to be cowed or to let his 17-month-old son’s life be defined by their acts. ‘For as long as he lives, this little boy will insult you with his happiness and freedom,’ he wrote.

In the past thirty years, the concept of parenting and the huge industry surrounding it have transformed childcare into obsessive, controlling, and goal-orientated labour intended to create a particular kind of child, and therefore a particular kind of adult.</p><p>Drawing on the study of human evolution and her own cutting-edge scientific research into how children learn, Gopnik shows that although caring for children is profoundly important, it is not a matter of shaping them to turn out a particular way. Children are designed to be messy and unpredictable, playful and imaginative, and to be very different both from their parents and from each other. The variability and flexibility of childhood lets them innovate, create, and survive in an unpredictable world. ‘Parenting’ won't make children learn – but caring parents let children learn by creating a secure, loving environment.</p><p>In&nbsp;<strong>The Gardener and the Carpenter</strong>, the pioneering developmental psychologist and philosopher Alison Gopnik argues that the familiar twenty-first-century picture of parenting is profoundly wrong – it's not just based on bad science, it's bad for children and their parents too.</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

In this interview he explains the difference between democracy and elections, why sortition and lottery might offer a way to improve our democracy and why the most important thing is for a population to be informed before making any decision.

        "episode_desc": "<p>What better way to talk about Flâneuse than to walk the streets of London with author Lauren Elkin. We stroll through Bloomsbury to talk about Virginia Woolf and other female walkers of the city as we discuss the themes behind her fascinating book. 'Flâneuse [flanne-euhze], noun, from the French. Feminine form of flâneur [flanne-euhr], an idler, a dawdling observer, usually found in cities. That is an imaginary definition.' If the word flâneur conjures up visions of Baudelaire, boulevards and bohemia – then what exactly is a flâneuse? In this gloriously provocative and celebratory book, Lauren Elkin defines her as ‘a determined resourceful woman keenly attuned to the creative potential of the city, and the liberating possibilities of a good walk’. Part cultural meander, part memoir, Flâneuse traces the relationship between the city and creativity through a journey that begins in New York and moves us to Paris, via Venice, Tokyo and London, exploring along the way the paths taken by the flâneuses who have lived and walked in those cities. From nineteenth-century novelist George Sand to artist Sophie Calle, from war correspondent Martha Gellhorn to film-maker Agnes Varda, Flâneuse considers what is at stake when a certain kind of light-footed woman encounters the city and changes her life, one step at a time.

But Farida lived in the mountains of northern Iraq — and what happened next was unimaginable. Her village was an ISIS target. ISIS jihadists murdered the men and boys, including her father and brother, before taking Farida and the other women prisoner. This is the story of what happened to Farida after she was captured: the beatings, the rapes, the markets where ISIS sold women like cattle, and Farida's realisation that the more resistant she became, the harder it was for her captors to continue their atrocities against her. So she struggled, she bit, she kicked, she accused her captors of going against their religion, until, one day, the door to her room was left unlocked. She took her chance and, with five younger girls in her charge, fled into the Syrian desert. Farida showed incredible courage in the face of the unthinkable, and now with The Girl Who Beat ISIS she bravely relives her story to bear witness.

This month Alex Clark and Will Rycroft talk to Anna Jean Hughes from digital publisher The Pigeonhole about the many different types of love and which books played an important role in shaping their perception of love and lust. Louis de Bernières comes in to talk about his latest collection of poetry and how love has influenced both that and his current fiction. And finally, in an extraordinary interview about her late husband Paul, Lucy Kalanithi talks about his memoir, When Breath Becomes Air, which has been sweeping up everyone who reads it. A profound and uplifting book about how to live a good life gives us a chance to talk about a very special kind of love. https://thepigeonhole.com/ https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1099471/of-love-and-desire/ https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1109814/when-breath-becomes-air/</p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on twitter: twitter.com/vintagebooks</p><p>Sign up to our bookish newsletter to hear all about our new releases, see exclusive extracts and win prizes: po.st/vintagenewsletter</p><p><br></p><p>Paul Kalanithi - When Breath Becomes Air</p><p>At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, the next he was a patient struggling to live.</p><p>When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a medical student asking what makes a virtuous and meaningful life into a neurosurgeon working in the core of human identity – the brain – and finally into a patient and a new father.</p><p>What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when when life is catastrophically interrupted? What does it mean to have a child as your own life fades away?</p><p>Paul Kalanithi died while working on this profoundly moving book, yet his words live on as a guide to us all.&nbsp;When Breath Becomes Air&nbsp;is a life-affirming reflection on facing our mortality and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a gifted writer who became both.</p><p><br></p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

A 'technical hitch' will not recur next month!</p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on twitter: twitter.com/vintagebooks</p><p>Sign up to our bookish newsletter to hear all about our new releases, see exclusive extracts and win prizes: po.st/vintagenewsletter</p><p><br></p><p>Irvine Welsh - A Decent Ride</p><p>A rampaging force of nature is wreaking havoc on the streets of Edinburgh, but has top shagger, drug-dealer, gonzo-porn-star and taxi-driver, ‘Juice’ Terry Lawson, finally met his match in Hurricane ‘Bawbag’?</p><p>Can Terry discover the fate of the missing beauty, Jinty Magdalen, and keep her&nbsp;idiot-savant&nbsp;lover, the man-child Wee Jonty, out of prison?</p><p>Will he find out the real motives of unscrupulous American businessman and reality-TV star, Ronald Checker?</p><p>And, crucially, will Terry be able to negotiate life after a terrible event robs him of his sexual virility, and can a new fascination for the game of golf help him to live without… A DECENT RIDE?</p><p>A Decent Ride&nbsp;sees Irvine Welsh back on home turf, leaving us in the capable hands of one of his most compelling and popular characters, ‘Juice’ Terry Lawson, and introducing another bound for cult status, Wee Jonty MacKay: a man with the genitals and brain of a donkey.</p><p>In his funniest, filthiest book yet, Irvine Welsh celebrates an un-reconstructed misogynist hustler – a central character who is shameless but also, oddly, decent –and finds new ways of making wild comedy out of fantastically dark material, taking on some of the last taboos. So fasten your seatbelts, because this is one ride that could certainly get a little bumpy…</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

In this fascinating memoir Green reveals that he first began collecting slang in the 1970s, noticing that the contemporary authorities (notably Eric Partridge) preferred the past to the present, unaware of the huge array of new slang being coined by the counter-culture. He ponders why he still does this strange, lonely job, exploring the satisfaction that can be gained by tracking down the first use of a term just encountered in one of the cheap dime novels he devours for research. The lexis leans towards pimping and prostitution, crime and imprisonment, violence and cruelty, drunken and drugged debauches: what does this say about the man who spends every day truffling for it?</p><p>A fascinating look at how one man has built a lexis of 125,000 words that includes 1,740 words for sexual intercourse, 1,351 for the penis, 540 for defecation/urination, 247 for fat, 219 for vomiting and 180 for anal sex,&nbsp;Odd Job Man&nbsp;will delight all those who love the words that the conventional dictionaries leave out.</p><p><br></p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",
