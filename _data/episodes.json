    "desc": "Each year, the Mayor of Oslo, Norway gifts a Christmas tree to the United Kingdom, in commemoration of the two countries' co-operation in the Second World War. The tree then makes the journey to Trafalgar Square in London, where it's on display throughout the holiday season. And each year, The Poetry Society commissions a leading poet to write a poem to then decorate the tree - with a little help from primary school children all over London! \nThis year's poem is called 'The Gift', and was written by Clare Pollard. You'll hear it read by three children, Pashya, Sophia and Stella from St Peter's C of E Primary School, who were amongst the many to contribute their thoughts and ideas to the poem. \nIf you're in London at all over Christmas, do go and visit the tree, and see the poem with beautiful artwork by Marcus Walters. It'll be in Trafalgar Square until 6 January. \nWe hope you enjoy, and Merry Christmas from all of us at The Poetry Society!",

Also, here’s your annual reminder to support your local independent bookshop instead of ordering everything online.

What is the ‘Zahir’ – this object that can take many forms and that consumes the people who find it? What does it represent? Is it the fanaticism of being in love? The ever-present threat (and temptation) of idealism? A subtle critique of Christian theology? Is the Zahir a microcosm of everything? Why is Borges so obsessed with obsession?\nPlus, it’s the annual drunken end-of-the night Thanksgiving ‘debate’ between Tamler and IDW stepmother extraordinaire Christina Hoff Sommers. Topics raised and then quickly dropped include Bernie for President, Melinda Gates, critic reviews of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and more. Stay tuned for the end when Christina finds her “notes”. (And for special cameos from David Sommers and Eliza). \n",

Why under certain conditions do the the left and right brains seem like they have different abilities and desires? What does this tell us about the ‘self’? Do we have two consciousnesses, but only that can speak? Does the left brain bully the right brain? Are we all just a bundle of different consciousnesses with their own agendas?

Plus: voxpops from Max Porter, Candice Carty-Williams, Wana Udobang and Sinéad Gleeson, who all told us what they’d read and loved recently; and our utter glee at discovering the back seat of a car makes an excellent makeshift recording studio, steamed up windows and all.

Listen in to hear about why we should all embrace our inner chaos, the ways our voices get co-opted by Big Technology, and for a more general chat about literature by authors like William Faulkner and Yaa Gyasi that encompasses a range of different voices. Plus, of course, all the usual recommendations.",

    "desc": "David and Tamler dive back into the Ted Chiang well and explore the fascinating world described in \"Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom.\" What if you could interact with alternate versions of yourself - versions that made different choices, had different jobs, or different partners? Would you get jealous of your other selves if they were more successful? Would you want them to be unhappy so you could feel better about your own choices and path? If your alternate self was in a good relationship with a woman, would you try to track down the version of that woman in this world? If you made an immoral choice but your other self made the moral one, what does that say about your character? And what does it say about free will and responsibility?\n So many questions, such an interesting story - turns out we need to dedicate another segment next time to conclude the discussion. Hope you enjoy it! If you haven't bought Exhalation (https://amzn.to/2p1hKBo) (Ted Chiang's new collection) We can't recommend it highly enough. This is the last story in that collection.  \nPlus – we select the topic finalists for our beloved Patreon listener-selected episode. Will Denial of Death make the cut again?\n",

Then they address the latest development in the literature around Benjamin Libet's famous study that, according to some people, proved that free will doesn't exist. How did that study get so much attention in the first place? Tamler proposes a Marxist analysis.

Kaminsky, born in the former Soviet Union but now an American citizen, describes his unrequited love for English: “sometimes a stranger can make love to the language a little better than the native person... of course it can also be very awkward too”.",

In Spring 2016 we spoke to Kevin Barry about his novel Beatlebone, and in celebration of his place on this year's Booker Prize longlist (for his latest novel Nightboat to Tangier) we thought we'd re-run the episode. Beatlebone is a wonderful novel about a very famous John's quest to reach a tiny island that he owns in Clew Bay, off the West Coast of Ireland. Inspired by his trip, our theme is 'down the rabbit hole', dedicated to all those literary escapes to the ends of the earth and to the centre of the mind. We'll be following that elusive rabbit's fluffy tail and lighting out for the territory with Huck Finn, breaking out of jail with the Count of Monte Cristo, and getting lost in all kids of mythical adventures. Come along for the ride, and enjoy a bit of time travel into the world of our younger selves - our equipment was a lot less pro in those days!",

Fair? Who's the fucking nihilist you bunch of crybabies!\nPlus - trolling.  What is it? Why do people do it? Can works of art troll their audience?

What’s the meaning of a foot massage? What counts as a miracle? Is failing to disregard your own feces a sufficient condition for a filthy animal? We have a lots to talk about, and time is short.

    "desc": "We know that literature - like all culture - is biased, but can books also be a way of recognising and combating stereotypes? Our guest, Dr Jennifer Eberhardt, is widely considered one of the world’s leading experts on racial bias, and her new book Biased is a comprehensive look at the science of unconscious bias and how it affects our society. With this show, we’re continuing our conversation about race and literature that we started with Reni Eddo-Lodge and Kishani Widyaratna in 2017 (you can find that show in our archive). Specifically, we're looking at racial bias: what it is, how it damages our society, and if there's anything we can do about it. So, join us for the next hour as we try to further decolonise our minds.\n\nEmail us: litfriction@gmail.com\nTweet us and find us on Instagram: @litfriction\n\nRecommendations on the theme, The Science of Bias:\nOctavia: Swing Time by Zadie Smith https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/565/56513/swing-time/9780141036601.html\nCarrie: Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2016/invisible-man-by-ralph-ellison/\n\nGeneral Recommendations:\nOctavia: Whereas by Layli Long Soldier https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/layli-long-soldier/whereas/9781529012804\nCarrie: Three Women by Lisa Taddeo https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/lisa-taddeo/work/three-women\nJennifer: Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/224792/just-mercy-by-bryan-stevenson/9780812984965/",

    "desc": "<p>A very special episode, live from London Book Fair: host Anna Fielding is joined by three authors for a discussion of historical fiction, the genre that unites their latest books:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Jess Kidd's</strong> <strong><em>Things in Jars</em></strong> is set in London in 1863. Bridie Devine, the finest female detective of her age, is taking on her toughest case yet: the kidnapping of a young girl. But Christabel Berwick is no ordinary child. She is not supposed to exist. As Bridie fights to recover the stolen child she enters a world of fanatical anatomists, crooked surgeons and mercenary showmen. <em>Things in Jars</em>&nbsp;is an enchanting Victorian detective novel that explores what it is to be human in inhumane times. (Canongate, April 2019)</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile <strong>Claire McGlasson's</strong> <strong><em>The Rapture</em></strong> centres on Dilys, a devoted member of a terribly English cult: The Panacea Society, populated almost entirely by virtuous single ladies. When she strikes up a friendship with Grace, a new recruit, God finally seems to be smiling upon her. </p><p>But Dilys is wary of their leader's zealotry and suspicious of those who would seem to influence her for their own ends. As her feelings for Grace bloom, the Society around her begins to crumble. Faith is supplanted by doubt as both women come to question what is true and fear what is real. (Faber &amp; Faber, June 2019)</p><p><br></p><p>And <strong><em>The Warlow Experiment</em></strong> by <strong>Alix Nathan</strong> takes the late eighteenth century as its setting. Inspired by a real document uncovered by Nathan, it tells the story of a semi-literatre labourer, John Warlow, recruited by a wealthy man of science to live, as an experiment, in the cellar of the main house, without human contact but with meals and luxuries provided, for a period of seven years. The experiment is, of course, a classic Enlightenment exercise gone mad, that promises unforeseen consequences for all included. In this seductive tale of self-delusion and obsession, Alix Nathan has created an utterly transporting historical novel which is both elegant and unforgettably sinister. (Serpent's Tail, July 2019)</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to Alix, Claire and Jess discuss their novels with Anna, tell you about books they've loved or yearn to read, and about their favourite independent bookshops. </p><p><br></p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

Shortlisted for the American National Book Award and the International Dylan Thomas Prize, it demolishes the borders between magical realism and science fiction, comedy and horror, fantasy and fabulism. Startling narratives map the realities of women's lives and the violence visited on their bodies, both in myth and in practice. It is a dark, shimmering slice of fiction, that reminded reviewers of Angela Carter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We caught up with Carmen in the summer of 2018 in Edinburgh, where she was appearing at the book festival, and asked her to tell us about books she loves and the bookshops she can't resist. Carmen responded with a brilliant selection of books with one thing in common: they are all retellings of myths.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Her Body and Other Parties</strong>&nbsp;is published by Serpent's Tail and out now in paperback from all good bookshops.</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

How is the forest in literature changing as the forests in our world disappear? This month we’re going into the woods, looking at literary forests from Shakespeare to Sondheim to Lovecraft and beyond. Our theme is inspired by our guest Luke Turner, editor of The Quietus, whose memoir Out of the Woods is a beautiful and frank examination of sexuality, love, religion, and London’s Epping Forest. We also have some news: next month we're launching our first ever minisode! So if you'd like more of us wanging on about books and maybe telling you some secrets, you are in luck. But for now, relax under a canopy of green and join us as we try to see the wood for the trees on Literary Friction.",

So we talk about Dostoevsky’s wild, complex, stream of consciousness masterpiece Notes From Underground. For this episode we focus on part 1 of the novella, and the philosophy behind it. Is the underground man an existentialist hero affirming his freedom in the face of a deterministic hyper-rationalist worldview? Or is he a lonely man consumed with guilt and self-loathing, constructing a pretentious post-hoc rationalization of his character and behavior? Plus, the American Psychological Association just issued guidelines for how to treat men who embrace traditional masculine ideologies. Is the backlash justified?\nThis episode is brought to you by Eero (http://www.eero.com/verybadwizards), Curiosity Stream (http://www.curiositystream.com/vbw), and the generosity of listeners like you.  \n",

We talked to author Ann Wroe, whose latest book Francis: A Life in Song is an unusual, beautiful, moving portrait through poetry of the life of St. Francis of Assisi and his resonance today. It’s an unusual and wonderful book, which has had glowing reviews, and it’s a perfect way to cap off the year on Literary Friction.",

This poem was commissioned by The Poetry Society for the Trafalgar Square Christmas Tree 2018 and you can read the text online at: poems.poetrysociety.org.uk/poems/look-into-my-lights The poem is displayed on a vibrant banner designed by James Brown around the tree until early January 2019. \n\nSince 2009, The Poetry Society has worked with the Royal Norwegian Embassy in London to create a poetry project inspired by the Trafalgar Square Christmas Tree, which is now established as a central part of the tradition. Poetry from workshops in Westminster primary schools is presented each year to one of the UK’s best children’s poets. Their task is to produce a new poem celebrating the gift of the tree from the Mayor of Oslo. The poem is read out at the official lighting up ceremony and displayed around the base of the tree. \n\nFind out more about The Poetry Society's Look North More Often programme: poetrysociety.org.uk/projects/look-north-more-often-the-trafalgar-square-christmas-tree/\n\nPhoto by Hayley Madden for The Poetry Society.",

    "desc": "In the famous words of the idealist philosopher George Berkeley, “To exist is to be perceived.” Our ideas and perceptions are the fundamental objects in the universe; there is no real world beyond them. Hume wrote (I think) that Berkeley’s arguments don’t admit of the slightest refutation, and they don’t inspire the slightest conviction. On Earth, that may be true. On Tlön, it’s false – the people there are “congenital idealists.” Their language, philosophy, literature, and religion presuppose idealism. It’s their common sense. And their philosophy starts to encroach on their reality. But what happens when we read and hear about Tlön – can their idealism invade our “real” world?  Will we start to lose our metaphysical bearings?  David and Tamler talk about Borges’s invasive, unsettling story “Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.”  Please listen so we can exist!\n(And speaking of things that may or may not exist, we also discuss the metaphysics of holes.)\nThis episode is brought to you by GiveWell (http://www.givewell.org) and the generous support of our listeners.  \n",

These are some of the questions that authors from Ernest Hemingway to Grayson Perry have asked, and questions that Thomas Page McBee addresses head on in his searching, beautiful and wise second book Amateur, the true story of his quest to become the first trans man to box at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Once a 'masculinity expert' for Vice, his essays and reportage have appeared in the New York Times, Playboy, Glamour, and Salon. We spoke to Thomas about Amateur, which was shortlisted for the 2018 Baillie Gifford Prize, and the need to drastically redefine what masculinity really means in contemporary culture.

Why does it seem less aversive to shake the hand of someone responsible for the death of thousands of civilians through military action than it does to shake the hand of a serial killer who has merely killed dozens? Are the rules we use to judge the moral atrocities of public officials different from the ones we use to judge private atrocities? Do they have the same basic foundations? Plus, we satisfy our listeners bloodlust by arguing about the new \"Journal of Controversial Ideas\" (because it would be cowardly not to). \nThis episode is brought to you by Givewell.org (http://www.givewell.org), and by the private morality of our generous supporters.  \n",

Why are there so many rich people in fiction? Should they be anything other than the object of ridicule and scorn? Are the rich different? To help answer these questions, we talked to award-winning Canadian novelist Patrick deWitt. His fourth novel, French Exit, is the story of Frances, an upper-class widow and her adult son, Malcolm, who flee from New York to Paris when their money runs out. Accompanying them is their cat in whom the body of Frances' dead ex-husband resides, along with, eventually, a medium, a French private investigator and a lonely sycophant. If that sounds absurd and funny - it is! So grab your champagne coup and stay with us for the next hour on Literary Friction.",

In it, a privileged young woman living on the upper East side in Manhattan, dissatisfied with her life, decides to embark on a year of sleep and seclusion in her apartment aided by lots of prescription drugs and a permissive psychiatrist.

How do we assign credences to ethical (as opposed to empirical) claims? Why has effective altruism become so popular, so fast, yet at the same time seem off-putting to many people?

I am trying to write into those disconnections and create new bridges.” Raymond Antrobus, Review contributor and winner of the Geoffrey Dearmer Prize, talks to Emily Berry about his forthcoming debut collection The Perseverance, his work as a poet-teacher in d/Deaf and hearing schools, literacy, elegy and the influence of cinema on his work. Poems in The Perseverance challenge and rework the canon as part of a process he describes as “developing a language to explain myself”, of “writing through trauma and coming to different conclusions that I can apply to new bodies of work”. He gives powerful readings of his poems ‘Sound Machine’  and ‘After Reading Ted Hughes’s “Deaf School” by the Mississippi River’.",

This month, we bring you a show dedicated to small towns in literature, partly recorded in front of a live audience at the Derby Book Festival, where we interviewed acclaimed author Jon McGregor about his latest novel, Reservoir 13. It tells the story of a girl's disappearance from a small village in the Peak District in England, and the aftershocks it leaves in the community for years to come. So listen in for our conversation with Jon, some thoughts about literary small town life, and join us in resisting the overwhelming urge to quote lyrics by Journey and John Cooger Mellancamp.",

And why is the debate on this topic so depressing? Plus, some deep thoughts on the intellectual dark web, how to join it, and what the analogy is supposed to reflect. \n",

Instead, we’ll be talking about all the other wonderful books that have taken us on the road and, usually, on a journey of discovery too. Our guest is writer Damian Le Bas, whose fascinating debut The Stopping Places is a journey through Gypsy Britain, in which he visits the places scattered across the country where his Gypsy family and ancestors made their temporary homes. So listen in for a show dedicated to the tradition of books that roam, road novels and their intrepid travelling protagonists, and other books that use journeys as their narrative frame, plus all the usual recommendations. Ideal listening for those of you that are on the move!",

They consider questions of shame, permission and catharsis, the challenges of working with difficult material and ‘breaking through’ – the ways in which writing works to bring the inside outside, and the influence of writers such as Sylvia Plath, Sharon Olds and Lucille Clifton. Benson also reflects on the sublime and its possibilities in contemporary poetry, with reference to Whitman, Rilke and Ginsberg. She reads her astonishing poems ‘Fly’ and ‘[Zeus] Anatomical Dolls’, both first published in The Poetry Review. To connect with more poetry, visit poetrysociety.org.uk",

Boys, Boys, Boys, was published in 2015, and she came in to talk to us about its follow-up, To Throw Away Unopened.

You might think that Buddhist conceptions of the self as illusory would reduce their fear of death (after all, if there’s no real self, why worry about it ceasing to exist?). But the evidence collected by Shaun and colleagues suggests exactly the opposite. Why would that be? \nPlus, David and Tamler choose six finalists for the Patreon listener selected episode (did Jordan Peterson make the list?), and we announce a special bonus for people who pre-order Tamler’s forthcoming book \"Why Honor Matters.\" Special Guest: Shaun Nichols.\n",

When a man is swept away by the river in the early hours of Shrove Saturday, an explanation has to be found: accident, suicide or murder? The village priest, John Reve, is privy to many secrets in his role as confessor. But will he be able to unravel what happened to the victim, Thomas Newman, the wealthiest, most capable and industrious man in the village? And what will happen if he can’t?</p><p>Moving back in time towards the moment of Thomas Newman’s death, the story is related by Reve – an extraordinary creation, a patient shepherd to his wayward flock, and a man with secrets of his own to keep. Through his eyes, and his indelible voice, Harvey creates a medieval world entirely tangible in its immediacy.</p><p><br></p><p>Read more about the book: http://po.st/LmknRr</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

Laurie joins us to talk about her cult status after creating the most popular course in Yale University history: Psychology and the Good Life. Why are we so bad at predicting what will make us happy? What makes it so hard to do the things we know are good for us? Why are young people more stressed, anxious, and overworked than they used to be? And how can we nudge ourselves into living better lives? Plus we take a test for determining the virtues that come easiest to us and the ones that come.. harder.\nThis episode is sponsored by Audible and Casper.  Special Guest: Laurie Santos.\n",

Out of print until now, feminist publisher Silver Press are reviving it this May. In the book, Nell speaks to author Ann Quin, the late, little-known British writer whose work has recently been thrust back into public attention, largely because indie publisher And Other Stories have released The Unmapped Country, a new collection of her stories and fragments. The book’s editor, writer and critic Jennifer Hodgson, joins us for the second segment.",

By the time the sea retreated, more than 18,500 people had been crushed, burned to death, or drowned.</p><p>It was Japan’s greatest single loss of life since the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. It set off a national crisis, and the meltdown of a nuclear power plant. And even after the immediate emergency had abated, the trauma of the disaster continued to express itself in bizarre and mysterious ways.</p><p>Richard Lloyd Parry, an award-winning foreign correspondent, lived through the earthquake in Tokyo, and spent six years reporting from the disaster zone. There he encountered stories of ghosts and hauntings. He met a priest who performed exorcisms on people possessed by the spirits of the dead. And he found himself drawn back again and again to a village which had suffered the greatest loss of all, a community tormented by unbearable mysteries of its own.</p><p>What really happened to the local children as they waited in the school playground in the moments before the tsunami?

For decades psychologists and economists have told us to develop traits like willpower and grit. But psychologist David DeSteno describes a better, easier, and more effective path--the emotions. We talk to David about his new (not-self-help) book \"Emotional Success,\" which argues that the emotions of gratitude, pride, and compassion can help us fulfill long-term goals and (as a special bonus) make us happier and better people.\nPlus, David and Tamler take a quiz that measures how utilitarian they are, and you won't believe the results!!!

Lullaby won France's most prestigious literary award, the Prix Goncourt, making Leïla the twelfth woman in history to do so, and it's since become an international sensation. So listen in as we discuss the fascinating and sometimes fraught place nannies occupy in our culture. From the magical perfection of Mary Poppins to the killer babysitters of slasher B-movies, these almost-mummies are the stuff of both dreams and nightmares.",

But first, we discuss the stages of Star Trek transporter cognition, whether Paul and David are closet-dualists, and whether the process of choosing a Dalai Lama suffers from p-hacking concerns.

Extricating Britain from Europe will be the greatest challenge this country has faced since the Second World War.

It tells the story of a young gay refugee from the Balkans, whose search for meaning in the midst of loneliness leads him to purchase a boa constrictor, in spite of his acute fear of snakes, and to befriend a talking cat he meets in a Helsinki gay bar.",

But first we tackle even more important questions about the human condition such as, why is it easier to detect the size of a hole with your tongue than with your little finger? And which moral \"dilemmas\" are actually moral no-brainers? (In the process, we even solve the problem of free speech on campus. You’re welcome.)  \n",

S. Eliot Prize</p><p>PBS Autumn Recommendation</p><p>Mancunia is both a real and an unreal city. In part, it is rooted in Manchester, but it is an imagined city too, a fallen utopia viewed from formal tracks, as from the train in the background of De Chirico’s paintings. In these poems we encounter a Victorian diorama, a bar where a merchant mariner has a story he must tell, a chimeric creature – Miss Molasses – emerging from the old docks. There are poems in honour of Mancunia’s bureaucrats: the Master of the Lighting of Small Objects, the Superintendent of Public Spectacles, the Co-ordinator of Misreadings. Metaphysical and lyrical, the poems in Michael Symmons Roberts’ seventh collection are concerned with why and how we ascribe value, where it resides and how it survives. Mancunia is – like More’s Utopia – both a no-place and an attempt at the good-place. It is occupied, liberated, abandoned and rebuilt. Capacious, disturbing and shape-shifting, these are poems for our changing times.</p><p><br></p><p>Read more at https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1112493/mancunia/#ZiVegydh6ISYfdki.99</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

We talked to three authors featured in the collection about their essays and the urgent need to publish more diverse voices: award-winning novelist Kit de Waal; the editor and publisher of Know Your Place, Nathan Connolly; and London-based writer and poet Abondance Matanda.",

David and Tamler continue their discussion on intelligence from our last episode by tackling the radioactive topic of group differences and IQ. Are there reliable differences in IQ across races? Given that IQ is strongly heritable, and that racial categories are based (in part) on biological differences, does it follow that group differences in IQ are due to biological differences across racial groups? (Could only a politically motivated science-denier conclude otherwise?) David argues that biological explanations for racial differences in IQ are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of genetics and race. It’s a complex argument, so if you start listening, please finish! (Oh and @VBWNoContext on Twitter, take a vacation, you’ve earned it!). Plus, more on neuroscientific explanations, and Tamler relates his experience of Hurricane Harvey.  \n",

As usual, our theme is inspired by our guest, and this month we’ll be playing a recording of a live interview Carrie did with the celebrated Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgaard a couple weeks ago at Waterstones Tottenham Court Road. Knausgaard is best known for his epic My Struggle series, but he was in town to talk about his new book, appropriately called Autumn, the first in a quartet of titles based around the seasons. In Autumn, he describes the world around him – from chewing gum to toilet bowls to frogs – to his unborn daughter. So tune in for a celebration of the ordinary things in literature, and a discussion about how writers from George Eliot to Elizabeth Strout have made them compelling and extraordinary.",

On Keith’s card it says he does ‘distribution and delivery’, which seems to consist of ‘a lot of driving around, getting out of the car for a few minutes and then getting back in’, Sam tells his mother. And so the days go by, Keith driving to a trading estate, ducking into a portakabin, all the while telling Sam stories about his first boss, Geoff Crozier, his mentor in distribution and delivery. As the weeks pass, Sam gets to know Keith’s friends, flirty Hazel-Claire from whom they buy two pasties every day at lunchtime, a variety of receptionists, and a few tantalising secrets from Keith’s past…</p><p>As in&nbsp;Days of the Bagnold Summer,&nbsp;Joff Winterhart is a master at depicting ordinary life in all its utterly poignant and funny mundanity.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Driving Short Distances&nbsp;</em>is the new book by Joff Winterhart, whose first graphic novel<em>, Days of the Bagnold Summer</em>, was described by Posy Simmonds as ‘original, funny, touching and beautifully observed’ and was shortlisted for the Costa Award for Best Novel.</p><p><br></p><p>\"<strong>In&nbsp;<em>Driving Short Distances</em>&nbsp;Joff Winterhart has created an unforgettable central player</strong>, Keith Nutt, who deserves to join Keith Talent in the short but potent list of great British literary Keiths.

Winterhart has delivered a perfect book, as good as mostly much better than any of the regular novels I’ve read so far this year. Like his first… its characters are superbly drawn. But with its themes of depression and its tender examination of the ways men talk (and fail to talk) to one another, it has a depth that book perhaps lacked.&nbsp;<em>Days of the Bagnold Summer</em>&nbsp;was shortlisted for the 2012 costa Novel award.

We interviewed award-winning American novelist Dana Spiotta about her latest book, Innocents and Others, which tells the story of two friends who are both filmmakers, and the stress their relationship suffers when an enigmatic woman named Jelly comes into their lives.

So, sit back, relax, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the show!",

You could even say that it’s a conversation about… conversations! As usual, our theme is inspired by our guest Sally Rooney, whose excellent debut novel Conversations with Friends tells the story of two female friends and former lovers, and the complicated relationship they fall into with an older married couple.

In the main segment they discuss the problems with measuring pain, pleasure, and happiness. When your doctor asks you to rate your pain between 1 and 10 and you say a 7, does your '7' reflect the same subjective experience as another person's '7'?  (That depends--have you experienced childbirth?) How can we get more accurate readings of pain and pleasure across different people with different experiences?

We interviewed two of the authors on their excellent shortlist: David France, whose narrative history How to Survive a Plague is a riveting and devastating first-hand account of the fight against AIDS in the USA; and Sarah Moss, whose fifth novel The Tidal Zone is a complex and beautiful story about family life in the wake of a serious medical emergency.

    "desc": "Do illustrations have a place in the novel? Pictures were commonplace in nineteenth-century books by authors like Thackeray and Dickens, and yet today almost all grown-up fiction is devoid of any illustrations, with a few notable exceptions including the work of W.G. Sebald and Douglas Coupland. Should a case be made for bringing them back? Our guest is the Irish writer Sara Baume whose first novel, Spill Simmer Falter Wither has won and been shortlisted for a whole host of prizes, including the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for Fiction. Her second novel, A Line Made by Walking, is not only illustrated with photographs, but is infused with ideas from contemporary art. Listen in as we talk to Sara and then discuss our favourite illustrations.",

Édouard Louis has caused a sensation in France with his autobiographical novel and its depiction of poverty, racism and homophobia. Ross Raisin has chosen the world of football as the setting for his tale of individuality and masculinity. Both authors give us the chance to look at love in a different way before Valentine's Day.

When she is born her parents hand her over to a childless peasant couple in the mountains. Aged two, and suffering from malnutrition on a diet of yam leaves, they leave Xiaolu with her illiterate grandparents in a fishing village on the East China Sea. It’s a strange beginning. A Wild Swans for a new generation, Once Upon a Time in the East takes Xiaolu from a run-down shack to film school in a rapidly changing Beijing, navigating the everyday peculiarity of modern China: censorship, underground art, Western boyfriends. In 2002 she leaves Beijing on a scholarship to study in Britain. Now, after a decade in Europe, her tale of East to West resonates with the insight that can only come from someone who is both an outsider and at home. Xiaolu Guo’s extraordinary memoir is a handbook of life lessons. How to be an artist when censorship kills creativity and the only job you can get is writing bad telenovela scripts. How to be a woman when female babies are regularly drowned at birth and sexual abuse is commonplace. Most poignantly of all: how to love when you’ve never been shown how.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on twitter: twitter.com/vintagebooks</p><p>Sign up to our bookish newsletter to hear all about our new releases, see exclusive extracts and win prizes: po.st/vintagenewsletter</p><p><br></p><p>Xiaolu Guo - One Upon a Time in the East</p><p>*Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award*&nbsp;</p><p>*Shortlisted for the Costa Biography Award*</p><p>*Shortlisted for the Jhalak Prize*</p><p>*Shortlisted for the Rathbones Folio Prize 2018*</p><p>*A&nbsp;<strong>Sunday Times&nbsp;</strong>Book of the Year<strong>*</strong></p><p>'This generation's&nbsp;Wild Swans'&nbsp;Daily Telegraph</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

The tradition of the Twelve Days of Christmas is a tradition of celebration, sharing and giving.

Chances at love and tricks with time.</p><p>There is frost and icicles, mistletoe and sledges. There’s a cat and a dog and a solid silver frog. There’s a Christmas cracker with a surprising gift inside.</p><p>There’s a haunted house and a SnowMama. There are Yuletides and holly wreaths. Three Kings. And a merry little Christmas time.</p><p>And for the icing on the Christmas cake, there are twelve festive recipes from Yuletides past and present.

(Honor and porn, presumably.)\" \nBryan’s wish is our command.  Welcome to “Honoraria” and “Puerto Rico”, currently at war over the five paragraph essay.   Plus, Dave relates how it feels to get the bulk of the critical feedback for once.

Suddenly he started receiving text messages asking if he was ok. Turning on the TV, Antoine watched the terrorist attacks in Paris unfolding around him and tried to call Hélène. She didn’t answer. That night Hélène was killed, along with 88 other people, at the Bataclan Theatre. Three days later, Antoine wrote an open letter to his wife’s killers on Facebook. He refused to be cowed or to let his 17-month-old son’s life be defined by their acts. ‘For as long as he lives, this little boy will insult you with his happiness and freedom,’ he wrote.

What standards do we use - do they involve a strong notion of free will that’s incompatible with determinism? If not, why should we think that moral praise and blame require agents to act with that sort of free will? David and Tamler argue over how much we can learn about moral responsibility from our responsibility practices in the domains of arts and sports. Plus, it’s Halloween – time to rev up the campus culture wars. Do concerns about “cultural appropriation” amount to a “war on Halloween”? \n",

A moving and important meditation on the violent reality of life in the US, it tells the stories of 10 children who died from gun violence in America on a random day in 2013. We'll also be talking about how violence manifests itself in American literature, from the brutal Westerns of Cormac McCarthy to the insightful nonfiction of authors like Steven Pinker and the hard-hitting journalism of Dave Cullen.

    "desc": "David and Tamler have their 100th episode hijacked briefly before taking it back like Wesley Snipes in Passenger 57. To celebrate the milestone Tamler pops some champagne, Dave sips his high priced Ivy League bourbon, and we both take a quiz designed by MIT that assesses our moral worldview and determines how driverless cars should be programmed. In the second segment we answer a bunch of questions our listeners submitted on Facebook and Twitter for an AMA. (We didn’t get to all of them, and some were cut not because they were bad questions but because our answers were incoherent. But we did our best.) Plus, has David changed his mind about Straw Dogs?  How would we argue if we switched positions in our big fights? And we expose the vast Partially Examined Life conspiracy that keeps us down in the iTunes (and Linux) ratings. Special Guests: Eliza Sommers and Isabella Pizarro.\n",

First, should a middle school perform \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" even if they have to use bad language the \"n-word,\" and talk about sexual assault? Tamler relates a story involving his daughter (who was supposed to play Scout) and a playwright who refused to allow his play to be censored. But when it comes to drama, middle school's got nothing on social psychology. Next, David and Tamler break down the latest controversy surrounding Princeton psychologist Susan Fiske's leaked column about the bullying destructo-critics and methodological terrorists that are challenging the establishment in the field. Finally, they give a spoiler-filled analysis of season 2 of Mr. Robot, a polarizing season for many fans. Tamler's suffering from a little theory fatigue, but David blows his mind with his explanation of what's <em>really </em>going on with the Dark Army and F-Society.

Yet the thing we call ‘parenting’ is a surprisingly new invention. In the past thirty years, the concept of parenting and the huge industry surrounding it have transformed childcare into obsessive, controlling, and goal-orientated labour intended to create a particular kind of child, and therefore a particular kind of adult.</p><p>Drawing on the study of human evolution and her own cutting-edge scientific research into how children learn, Gopnik shows that although caring for children is profoundly important, it is not a matter of shaping them to turn out a particular way. Children are designed to be messy and unpredictable, playful and imaginative, and to be very different both from their parents and from each other. The variability and flexibility of childhood lets them innovate, create, and survive in an unpredictable world. ‘Parenting’ won't make children learn – but caring parents let children learn by creating a secure, loving environment.</p><p>In&nbsp;<strong>The Gardener and the Carpenter</strong>, the pioneering developmental psychologist and philosopher Alison Gopnik argues that the familiar twenty-first-century picture of parenting is profoundly wrong – it's not just based on bad science, it's bad for children and their parents too.</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

And if so, was there wisdom in his repugnance--did the feeling offer any moral insight about the podcast's value?&nbsp;How did an emotion that originally evolved for pathogen avoidance get into moralizing business anyway? And why do white people kiss their dogs?

We stroll through Bloomsbury to talk about Virginia Woolf and other female walkers of the city as we discuss the themes behind her fascinating book. 'Flâneuse [flanne-euhze], noun, from the French. Feminine form of flâneur [flanne-euhr], an idler, a dawdling observer, usually found in cities. That is an imaginary definition.' If the word flâneur conjures up visions of Baudelaire, boulevards and bohemia – then what exactly is a flâneuse? In this gloriously provocative and celebratory book, Lauren Elkin defines her as ‘a determined resourceful woman keenly attuned to the creative potential of the city, and the liberating possibilities of a good walk’. Part cultural meander, part memoir, Flâneuse traces the relationship between the city and creativity through a journey that begins in New York and moves us to Paris, via Venice, Tokyo and London, exploring along the way the paths taken by the flâneuses who have lived and walked in those cities. From nineteenth-century novelist George Sand to artist Sophie Calle, from war correspondent Martha Gellhorn to film-maker Agnes Varda, Flâneuse considers what is at stake when a certain kind of light-footed woman encounters the city and changes her life, one step at a time.

It tells the story of two young girls who decide to investigate a housewife’s disappearance from their tight-knit estate during the heat wave of 1976, and the unlikely truth they uncover. In honour of rebels and misfits everywhere, our theme this month is BLACK SHEEP.

Is the act itself unforgivable, or is it Tomas’s behavior afterwards that makes him despicable? How blameworthy is Tomas for his display of cowardice? Is it even cowardice since he didn’t have time to think about it?&nbsp;What’s the deal with that creepy janitor and all the tooth brushing scenes? Why can’t Yoel and Tamler agree about the answers to any of these questions?&nbsp;Plus, more on the Redskins and Tamler tells an embarrassing story from his past.</p><h1>Links</h1><ul><li><a href=\"http://yoelinbar.net\">Yoel Inbar </a>[yoelinbar.net]</li><li><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/the-americans-sex-scene.html\">On that one awkward sex scene from The Americans</a> [vulture.com]</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia\">Scandinavia</a>&nbsp;[wikipedia.org]</li><li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3630276/\">Force Majeure</a> [imdb.com]</li><li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1717353/\">Louie Season 1 Episode 9 \"Bully\" </a>[imdb.com]</li></ul>\n Special Guest: Yoel Inbar.\n",

But Farida lived in the mountains of northern Iraq — and what happened next was unimaginable. Her village was an ISIS target. ISIS jihadists murdered the men and boys, including her father and brother, before taking Farida and the other women prisoner. This is the story of what happened to Farida after she was captured: the beatings, the rapes, the markets where ISIS sold women like cattle, and Farida's realisation that the more resistant she became, the harder it was for her captors to continue their atrocities against her. So she struggled, she bit, she kicked, she accused her captors of going against their religion, until, one day, the door to her room was left unlocked. She took her chance and, with five younger girls in her charge, fled into the Syrian desert. Farida showed incredible courage in the face of the unthinkable, and now with The Girl Who Beat ISIS she bravely relives her story to bear witness. Searing and immediate, this is the first memoir by a young woman that shows first-hand what life is like for innocents caught up in the maelstrom of day-to-day life with ISIS.

A feminist classic from the 90s recently published in the UK for the first time, I Love Dick is a hybrid of memoir, fiction and theory that focuses on the main character’s desire for an academic named Dick. We rarely see the object of our desire for what they really are, and literature has always been a rich medium through which to explore these romantic abstractions. So this month's title, taken from an anecdote in I Love Dick, is the perfect starting point for a show all about the sometimes troubling vagaries of our deepest longings. ",

Raphael Honigstein and Danny Kelly talk football ahead of Euro 2016; how did Germany effect Das Reboot, what's the future for the sport amid all the corruption and who do you want to draw in the office sweepstake? Richard Askwith tells us what made the Czech runner Emil Zatopek so special. Anders Ericsson, the man behind the 10,000 hours rule explains why practice makes perfect and talent is a myth. And finally in tribute to Muhammad Ali we hear an excerpt from George Plimpton's Shadow Box, soon to be published by Vintage in the UK along with his other amazing participatory sports journalism books.

Bloodied but unbowed, he holds his own in the bout – and brings back this timeless book on boxing and its devotees, among them Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Ernest Hemingway, and Norman Mailer.</p><p><br></p><p>Shadow Box&nbsp;is one of Plimpton’s most engaging portraits of professional sport seen through the eyes of an inquisitive and astute hopeful. From the gym, the locker room, the ringside, and even in the harsh glare of the ring itself, Plimpton documents what it truly means to be a boxer in some of the finest writing of his career.</p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

Yanis Varoufakis talks with Owen Jones about his life as an activist, his arrests on the picket line and his own father's struggles with oppresive rule that led to imprisonment in a concentration camp. Alex Andreou, winner of the inaugural Jane Grigson Trust Award, brings food and memory into the studio as we talk about childhood favourites, what real Greek food is and how caring for his mother has brought Greek culture and food flooding back into his writing. Finally we head to the British Museum with Caroline Alexander to look at Greek antiquity and the age of Homer. Why did she want to write a new translation of the Iliad and what can we learn today from this ancient text?\n\nThe nearest thing to a time machine is this week's Vintage Podcast.\n\nPlease leave comments to let us know what you think and we'll see you next month for more bookish goodness.\n\nThe full conversation with Alex Andreou can be found here:...

What is society trying to express in the way it punishes criminals?&nbsp;And since people from all sides of the political spectrum agree that the prison population is way too big, is there a way to convey that meaning with alternative forms of sanctions? David and Tamler discuss Yale Law Professor Dan Kahan's classic paper \"What do alternative sanctions mean?\"&nbsp;that addresses these questions. But first, Tamler gets sanctimonious about other people being sanctimonious about guns on campus.&nbsp;At the risk of angering \"that student,\"&nbsp;we \"go there.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/02/23/university_of_houston_faculty_reacts_to_texas_campus_carry_gun_law.html\">University of Houston Faculty Devises Pointers on How to Avoid Getting Shot by Armed Students </a>by Elliott Hannon [slate.com]</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/A-PowerPoint-Slide-Advises/235418\">A PowerPoint Slide Advises Professors to Alter Teaching to Pacify Armed Students</a>&nbsp;by Rio Fernandes [chronicle.com]</li><li>Kahan, D.

He talks about the involvement of poets such as Heaney, Longley, Carson and Muldoon, and his own long career as a writer. His poems – modest, humorous, deeply felt and generally slow to appear – have latterly been written in a “mad excitement” he remains suspicious of – “the belated release of something”. Ormsby also talks movingly about suffering from Parkinson’s disease and its effect on his writing. He reads his poem ‘Grandfather’s Week’, published in The Poetry Review, 105:4. His latest book is Goat's Milk, New & Selected Poems, published by Bloodaxe in 2015.",

This month Alex Clark and Will Rycroft talk to Anna Jean Hughes from digital publisher The Pigeonhole about the many different types of love and which books played an important role in shaping their perception of love and lust. Louis de Bernières comes in to talk about his latest collection of poetry and how love has influenced both that and his current fiction. And finally, in an extraordinary interview about her late husband Paul, Lucy Kalanithi talks about his memoir, When Breath Becomes Air, which has been sweeping up everyone who reads it. A profound and uplifting book about how to live a good life gives us a chance to talk about a very special kind of love. https://thepigeonhole.com/ https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1099471/of-love-and-desire/ https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1109814/when-breath-becomes-air/</p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on twitter: twitter.com/vintagebooks</p><p>Sign up to our bookish newsletter to hear all about our new releases, see exclusive extracts and win prizes: po.st/vintagenewsletter</p><p><br></p><p>Paul Kalanithi - When Breath Becomes Air</p><p>At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer.

What do you do when when life is catastrophically interrupted? What does it mean to have a child as your own life fades away?</p><p>Paul Kalanithi died while working on this profoundly moving book, yet his words live on as a guide to us all.&nbsp;When Breath Becomes Air&nbsp;is a life-affirming reflection on facing our mortality and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a gifted writer who became both.</p><p><br></p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

    "desc": "‘Awater’, written by Martinus Nijhoff in 1934, is considered the great Dutch modernist poem. Hailed by Brodsky as “the future of poetry”, it is still barely known outside the Netherlands. In it, the poet-narrator trails his mysterious neighbour – Awater – through the city night before abandoning the trail in a train station. Is the poem about the imagination, the unconscious mind, about bereavement, about the existential hollow in the wake of the First World War, about T.S. Eliot, about religion and the old world, about the future? With the help of David Colmer, Professor Wiljan van den Akker, poets Onno Kosters and Astrid Alben, and artist-writer Bette Adriaanse, Jane Draycott looks for answers to these questions. This audio piece is supported by the Dutch Foundation for Literature.",

It is delightfully elusive and warrants repeated reading. A poem which crept up on me and won me over with its spell and its surprising phrases - 'urging tangerine starward', 'seeking gauze to pull away''. This is a poem which feels longer than it is because it packs in a lot - lush and distilled.'' - Roddy Lumsden.\n\nImage: Moonrise over Ghost Ranch © Steve O'Bryan www.wildbasinphotography.com\n",

Who was Spike&nbsp;Lee criticizing with his depiction of the characters in&nbsp;this&nbsp;community?&nbsp;Why did Mookie start the riot at Sal's? Was his action justified?

It is impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all. The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind. It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his understanding; it seeks to annihilate rather than to convert. Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys a community and makes brotherhood impossible. It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue. Violence ends by defeating itself. It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers.&nbsp;</p><p>- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there are plenty of good people in America, but there are also plenty of bad people in America and the bad ones are the ones who seem to have all the power and be in these positions to block things that you and I need. Because this is the situation, you and I have to preserve the right to do what is necessary to bring an end to that situation, and it doesn't mean that I advocate violence, but at the same time I am not against using violence in self-defense. I don't even call it violence when it's self-defense, I call it intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>- Malcolm X</p> Special Guest: Yoel Inbar.\n",

(No.) Is it a psychologist who embraces a computational, modular theory&nbsp;of the mind? (No. Well, maybe…we’re not sure.) Are they psychologists who are part of a&nbsp;cult that fanatically endorse evolutionary explanations for every aspect&nbsp;of human judgment and behavior? (No! Well, most of them aren’t, anyway.)&nbsp;So what are they? And why do they generate so much hostility?</p><p>Plus, we go back to Genesis (the real story of how we evolved) to&nbsp;offer another thought experiment: what is it like to be Adam and Eve&nbsp;before eating the forbidden fruit? What is it like not to know good&nbsp;and evil?

Looking back, I never was aware of feeling that close to death, but actually if you think about it, just living every day there is a very small but definitely existing chance of death, whatever you're doing, wherever you are.'  \n\nImage courtesy of Ryoko Uyama",

In this fascinating memoir Green reveals that he first began collecting slang in the 1970s, noticing that the contemporary authorities (notably Eric Partridge) preferred the past to the present, unaware of the huge array of new slang being coined by the counter-culture. He ponders why he still does this strange, lonely job, exploring the satisfaction that can be gained by tracking down the first use of a term just encountered in one of the cheap dime novels he devours for research. The lexis leans towards pimping and prostitution, crime and imprisonment, violence and cruelty, drunken and drugged debauches: what does this say about the man who spends every day truffling for it?</p><p>A fascinating look at how one man has built a lexis of 125,000 words that includes 1,740 words for sexual intercourse, 1,351 for the penis, 540 for defecation/urination, 247 for fat, 219 for vomiting and 180 for anal sex,&nbsp;Odd Job Man&nbsp;will delight all those who love the words that the conventional dictionaries leave out.</p><p><br></p>  For information regarding your data privacy, visit <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a>",

Should the government frame issues like organ donation in ways that will benefit society? How much of a threat are nudges to our autonomy? Should Apple take steps to ensure that people can control themselves when making in-app purchases? Tamler even comes up with a \"theory,\" which means that there must have been something wrong with him. Please note that portions of the audio during the second segment are little spotty, likely due to a hex or poltergeist in one of the microphones.&nbsp; We'll have that worked out for the next episode.&nbsp; Enjoy! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(For the handful who have asked--if you like the music David makes for the podcast, you can listen/download to your heart's content at www.soundcloud.com/peezismyname).</p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li>Danziger, S., Levav, J., &amp; Avnaim-Pesso, L.

His latest book, 'Dispatcher', is published by Granta. \n\nJonny Steinberg is the author of several books about South Africa's transition to democracy. His next book, 'A Man of Good Hope', will be published in January 2015. He teaches African Studies and Criminology at the University of Oxford.\n\n‘Johannesburg is such an enormously contradictory place, it’s a place of great fear it’s a place of high walls and electric fences, and yet it is also a place of wall-lessness in such profound ways… it is a very mercurial place, it’s of great fear and yet extraordinary energy.’\n",

Wolff writes in Swedish, and her story in the issue is based in Spain. Here she discusses the tension she felt between a ‘Spanishness’ and ‘Swedishness’, when writing and between a rational way of being and a magical way of thinking. She also discusses Lorca, Dante, literary travellers and their guides and the idea of irrationality and the artistic temperament. \n\n‘I think in the beginning it was a crisis. I started to write because I felt the need to fit in, and not be an outsider... I have felt bound to an outsideness and an otherness.’ \n\nImage by Håkan Sandbring",

Granta artistic director Michael Salu, photographer Afshin Dehkordi (BBC, artistic consultant to the Brighton Photo Fringe and festival director of Bread & Roses Centennial) and Daniel Campbell Blight (writer, curator and talks assistant at the Photographers’ Gallery) then explored the relationship between subject and photographer, the cultural and social significance of controversial imagery and the responsibility the media should take when selecting images for publication.",

When Damani mounts an economic and moral defense for reparations for the descendants of slaves, David prefers to point to the difficulties in deciding who gets paid ( someone who's 1/16th descended from slaves? Jamaican-Americans? African immigrants?) and who should be responsible for paying (only people whose descendants benefitted from slavery? all non-slave descended taxpayers?). Tamler proposes (taking a note from Lenny Bruce) that if we use the N-word often enough it will lose its sting, and decides to practice what he preaches. And Damani reveals a surprising theory about race and geography (surprising for a Black man, at least) that leaves Tamler awkwardly speechless.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who are visually inclined: here's a one-minute set of behind-the-scenes clips from our Google+ Hangout:</p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/wTQXukR7jRg?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"640\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\"></iframe><h3>Links</h3><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger\">Nigger</a> [wikipedia.org]</li><li>Leonardo DiCaprio <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Django-Unchained-Features-Some-Leonardo-DiCaprio-Real-Blood-34804.html\">bleeds</a> for his role in Django Unchained [cinemablend.com]</li><li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfNhiRGQ-js\">Lenny Bruce- Are there any niggers here tonight?</a> [youtube.com]&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/baby-slapped-on-plane-571923\">60-year old white man slaps Black baby </a>&nbsp;[thesmokinggun.com]&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/views/truth-behind-40-acres-and-mule?noredirection=true\">The truth about 40 Acres and a Mule</a> [theroot.com]</li><li><a href=\"http://www.inmotionaame.org/print.cfm;jsessionid=f8302909661362137529896?migration=8&amp;bhcp=1\">The \"great migration\" of American Blacks out of the South</a> [inmotionaame.org]</li><li><a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/views/untold-story-unknown-hero\">1811 Louisiana Slave Rebellion</a> [theroot.com]</li><li><a href=\"http://www.sundancechannel.com/films/iconoclasts-dave-chappelle-maya-angelou-episode-6-season-2/\">Maya Angelou and Dave Chappelle on Iconoclasts</a> [sundancechannel.com]</li><li>Bonus:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg6J1Skptbs\">Dave Chappelle imagines reparations</a> [youtube.com]&nbsp;</li></ul> Special Guest: Joseph Damani McDole.\n",
